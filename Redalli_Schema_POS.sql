-- ================== instructions =======================
-- The user ADMINISTRATOR is created and configured on pages 229ff. 
-- ADMINISTRATOR should be the owner of the POS schema as SYSTEM cannot grant privileges 
-- to itself und thus might lead to issues later. 
-- Open the SQL console as ADMINISTRATOR
create schema POS; -- the owner will be administrator
-- Next, run the create.sql files from the download directory as user administrator.	
-- The users REFDEV01 and DEVELOPER are created on page 237.
grant select on SCHEMA pos to DEVELOPER; -- the user with role redalli_developer
grant select on SCHEMA pos to SAPHANADB; -- the A4H user
grant select, execute on SCHEMA pos TO _sys_repo WITH GRANT OPTION;
-- Open the SQL console as user REFDEV01	
grant select, insert, update, delete, execute on SCHEMA REFDEV01 TO _SYS_REPO WITH GRANT OPTION; 
-- Open the SQL console as SYSTEM (A4H tenant) user 	
grant select on SCHEMA _SYS_BIC to SAPHANADB; 

-- Now, execute the following command to import the data using the control file: 
IMPORT FROM CONTROL FILE '/<file_path>/data.ctl';
-- for each dimension. For trouble shooting see
