# Welcome to your Redalli repository!

"Redalli" is a fictional bricks-and-mortar retailer and the running use case of the book "SAP BW/4HANA 2.0" (see https://bit.ly/3gu8X1k). Although the books is written as a guide to SAP BW/4HANA 2.0,  it is not meant as a click-through training material. Hence this repository.

Before you start read the "Redalli POS schema" SQL file. It references the pages that show you how to create the developer, administrator, and analyst roles required to follow the Redalli use case. Once the users and their roles have been created, run the corresponding sections in the aforementioned SQL file.
